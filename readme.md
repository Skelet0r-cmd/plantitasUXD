## 1. Introduction

Taking care of interior plants can be a challenging task, especially for those who are new to gardening or have a busy lifestyle. Fortunately, mobile applications can help users keep their plants healthy and thriving. There are already several plant care apps available, such as Planta, Gardenia, and Biophilia, that provide users with information on watering, fertilizing, and potting requirements for different types of plants. However, there is still room for improvement in terms of user experience and features.

With this project we will be focusing on developing an application from the start based on the Elements of the User Experience from Jesse James Garrett to study and learn about this aproach that prioritizes the final user needs.

## 3. Strategy

The first step under the Elements of User Experience is the Strategy plane, which focuses on incorporating not only what the people running the application want to get out of it but what the users want to get out of the application.

From this aproach, a Value Proposition Canvas is used to determined what the people wants to earn from our solution and how are we gonna respond to those needs.

## 4. Solutions Scope

The application is designed for users interested in caring for the health of their plants. It is suitable for both beginners and experienced hobbyists. It provides step-by-step tips for plant care, including basic and advanced information. It allows you to keep a detailed record of your plants and track their progress. It also offers advanced features, such as pruning techniques and pest control. In short, it is a versatile application that helps users to effectively care for their plants and improve their gardening skills.

## 5. Benchmark

In order to develop an application that meets the expectations and needs of users, it is essential to carry out an exhaustive analysis of existing applications on the market, especially those that are direct competitors. This process, known as benchmarking, allows us to identify both the shortcomings and the positive aspects of these applications, in order to integrate them optimally into our own product.

By studying competing applications, we can learn from their mistakes and avoid repeating them in our application. In addition, we can identify successful features and functionalities that we can adopt and implement in our solution, thus providing a superior experience to our users.

Benchmarking analysis provides us with an objective perspective and helps us understand market expectations and user demands. By leveraging this information, we can design and develop an application that stands out from the competition and effectively meets the needs and aspirations of our users.

In short, benchmarking analysis allows us to recognize the strengths and weaknesses of competing applications, optimally integrating the positive aspects and avoiding the identified mistakes. This helps us to create an application that aligns with market expectations and delivers an exceptional user experience.

## 6. Customer Journey Map

The Customer Journey Map is a valuable tool to understand the user experience in their interaction with our product or service. Through the detailed mapping of each stage, from the first contact to the subsequent interaction, we can identify emotions, needs and critical moments. This analysis highlights challenges and opportunities to improve the experience and design exceptional solutions. By immersing ourselves in the user's world, we create memorable experiences and strengthen the relationship with them.
